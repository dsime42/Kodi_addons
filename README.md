# Kodi_addons
This is a repsitory of [kodi](https://kodi.tv/) addons that I have built.

* **plugin.video.pbsnewshour** is a plugin that I built for watching [PBS NewsHour's](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/videos/) broadcasts. Most the work is done in the file default.py, which scrapes PBS's sites, finds links to the videos, and passes these links to Kodi so that users can watch them! The addon requires Kodi's [youtube addon](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:YouTube). I wrote a [blog post](http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2017/03/11/my-first-kodi-addon-pbs-newshour/) describing how the addon works.

* **plugin.video.pbsnewshouryoutube** is a plugin that I built using the existing [youtube Kodi addon](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:YouTube). This addon is also for watching PBS NewsHour. This addon works great, but I wanted to build an addon from scratch so I built the addon mentioned above. This addon also requires Kodi's youtube addon.
